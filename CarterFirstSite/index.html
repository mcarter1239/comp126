    <h1>My personal website I guess</h1>
    <h2>I'm going for a real 90s web look with <a id="colors">wacky colors</a>
    </h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <strong>strong stuff</strong> and <em>stuff to be emphasized</em>. I already
        have four tags, but just because I can, here they are in an unorderd list.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>h1 tag for the header</li>
        <li>p tag for the paragraph</li>
        <li>strong tag for bold</li>
        <li>em tag for italics/emphasis</li>
        <li>bonus!!!!! ul and li tags for the list</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's a link to my <a href="https://twitter.com/dttranslatebot">twitter bot</a> (always have to plug your
        projects where you can right?). I also used to
        do a lot of photography, so here is one of my favorite pictures: <br><br> <img src="flower.jpg" alt="Burning Flower"

    <p class="test">I really just need more stuff to populate so I'm going to try knocking out two for one. If I've
        done it right,
        this paragraph will be targeted using a class called "test" and a selection pseudo-element. This
        means that selecting any text in this paragraph will highlight it black and turn the font color aqua, but this
        will not happen in other paragraphs.</p>
